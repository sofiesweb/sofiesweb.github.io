            <p>Domestic short-haired cats are characterised by a wide range of colouring, and typically "revert to type"

                    silvestris
                    lybica</i>). Their ancestors were among the cats that were first domesticated in the <a

                longhaired breeds like the Turkish Van and the Turkish Angora through inbreeding and natural selection.
            </p>

            <p>Longhaired cats were imported to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Britain">Britain</a>
                and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> from <a

                there
                are indications that they appeared in Europe as early as the 14th century due to the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades">Crusades</a>. The Turkish Angora was used to improve
                the

                However,
                there is a strong connection between Angoras and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_(cat)">Persians</a>. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Catton_the_younger">Charles Catton</a>, in his 1788 book

                alternative names for the same breed.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Angora#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The Persian cat was developed from Turkish angora mutations by British and American cat fanciers.
                Although
                some cat associations think the Persian cat is a natural breed, in the 19th century Persians and Angoras
                were identical. In 1903, F. Simpson wrote in her book The Book of the Cat:<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Angora#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The Angora of the 20th century was used for improvement in the Persian coat, but the type has always been
                divergent from the Persian – particularly as the increasingly flat-faced <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_cat">show cat</a>Persian has been developed in the last few
                decades.</p>

            <p>In the early 20th century, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk_Forest_Farm_and_Zoo">Ankara
                    Zoo</a> began a breeding program to protect and preserve pure white Angora cats.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Angora#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The zoo
                particularly
                prized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd-eyed_cat">odd-eyed</a> specimens (i.e., with one blue
                and
                one amber eye); however the cats were chosen only by their color (white)—no other criterion was used.
                Despite the lack of selective breeding and no consideration given for the deafness problem, Ankara Zoo
                cats
                have a very similar type.</p>

            <p>The Turkish Angora, which was brought to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a> in
                1963,
                was accepted as a championship pedigreed breed in 1973 by the Cat Fanciers' Association.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Angora#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> However, until
                1978
                only white Angoras were recognized. Today, all North American registries accept the Turkish Angora in
                many
                colors and patterns. While numbers are still relatively small, the gene pool and base of fanciers are
                growing.</p>

            <p>Breeders in Turkey feel that the cat fancy’s fine-boned version of their national breed is
                unrepresentative
                of the true Turkish cats, which are much sturdier. American “Turkish” Angoras may have only a minimal
                remnant of the original Ankara Zoo DNA and are only “purebred on paper".<sup>

    <section>
        <ul>
            <p>The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupar_Angus">Coupar Angus</a> in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a>, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual
                fold in
                their middle, making her resemble an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl">owl</a>.
                When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a
                neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Fold#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Ross registered the
                breed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governing_Council_of_the_Cat_Fancy">Governing
                    Council

                1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help
                of
                geneticist Pat Turner.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Fold#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_program">breeding program</a> produced 76 kittens in
                the
                first three years—42 with folded
                ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_gene">dominant gene</a>.<sup><a

            <p>Susie's only reproducing offspring was a female Fold named Sans who was also white; a second kitten was
                neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Sans' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish
                Fold
                cats share a common ancestry to Susie.<sup><a

                the
                GCCF withdrew registrations in 1971 due to crippling
